# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Development Methodology

- Follow **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: write test cases first, then implement code to make them pass.
- Use **Puppeteer** for front-end/end-to-end testing.
- TDD cycle: Red (write failing test) → Green (write minimal code to pass) → Refactor.
